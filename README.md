# ZENIT multimeter
C code for ZENIT multimeter's control board.
ZENIT multimeter is an opensource & openhardware measurement device with error about 0.01% (depending on PCB design and final calibration). You can measure DC voltage (3 manual ranges (-4V,4V; -40V,40V; -400V,400V), auto-range), DC current (2 manual ranges with auto range option (-40mA,40mA; -400mA,400mA) and another 1 manual range on different input terminals (-5A,5A)), resistance up to 10MOhms, PN passage voltage, temperature (RTD and NTC sensors). Multimeter is able to comunitate throught SCPI commands (UART or WIFI).
This multimeter was developed for final national round of high schoolers electronics competition "ZENIT v elektronike". More info and documentation [here](http://dvaluch.web.cern.ch/dvaluch/zenit/).
